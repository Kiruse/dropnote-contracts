# Dropnote
This **was** a smart contract for the Dropnote system, however, I decided against using this approach. The smart contract effectively only acted as a storage system anyways. The actual E2EE of the dapp needed to be handled by the frontend either way. This archive exists solely for portfolio purposes, if even that.
